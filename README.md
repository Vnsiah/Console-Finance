At the bottom of your script file, I'd recommend setting up a console log template literal that you can plug variables in which will result in clean and organized console logs that you can clearly see each of the required logs. Currently, you have several arrays being console logged that don't quite describe what they represent.

Per the assignment instructions, it requires each of the following console logs: 
The number of months in the dataset, which would be the length of the 'finances' array.
The net total, you can iterate through each item in the array, adding them together. I'd recommend utilizing stackoverflow if you don't know how to do this. Stackoverflow will become your best friend.
The average change over each month. Once you have the total amount, you can divide that amount by the length of the array.
The greatest and least amount. Similarly to the total, you can create a sort function that sorts the data from greatest to least, then the greatest amount would be the first item in the new array, and the least amount would be the last item in the array.
